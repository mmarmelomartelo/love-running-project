Welcome to Love Running Project from Marcelo Montenegro

This is a coding exercise at Code Institute. This website is based on a student template using Gitpod and uses only HTML and CSS as technologies. This is the initial README file, and this page will be updated until the end of this project.
Come back later to see the final project up running!
